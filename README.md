# Sharing is Caring - Final Project for our Web Development Course at DCI



## Project Details

This project serves as the final assignment for our Web Development course at DCI. As a team of five, our goal throughout the 7-week project duration was to write clean and well-documented code while enjoying the process of self-improvement. Another objective was to present a functional application that our classmates and other participants could use on the day of the final presentation. As a team, we take pride in the results we have achieved. If you want to see our project, it is  [here](https://sharing-is-caring-app.vercel.app/)
